# Accessible University website for PhD testing

This repository hosts the code to implement a (slightly different) version of the [Accessible University](https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/AU/) website used for testing the tools developed as part of my PhD thesis in Computer Science and Engineering at Alma Mater Studiorum - Universit√† di Bologna.

Enjoy!
